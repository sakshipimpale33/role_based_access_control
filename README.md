# Role Based Access Control (RBAC) Application

This is a **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)** application built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **Passport.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**. This application demonstrates user authentication and authorization based on roles like **admin**, **moderator**, and **client**. You can use this application as a starting point for your projects that require user authentication and role-based authorization.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Supports **email & password** authentication with the option to integrate OAuth/OAuth2.0 (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.).
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with different routes for admins, moderators, and users.
- **Mongoose**: ORM for MongoDB to store user data and manage authentication.
- **Passport.js**: Used for local email & password authentication.
- **MVC Pattern**: Follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern for clear code separation.
- **Session Management**: Manages sessions using **express-session** and **MongoDB store** to persist login even after server reboot.

The application is almost **production-ready**, with the necessary features and optimizations for secure and efficient authentication and authorization.
